::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Installation::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Just put them in the Photoshop Presets > Custom Shapes folder. It 
will most likely be something like:

C:\Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop Folder\Presets\Custom Shapes

Then, in Photoshop, open the Custom Shape Tool (Press U on the 
keyboard and choose the rounded star shape), and in the Custom 
Shapes box just load the shapes like you would load a normal brush.

For a more detailed explaination of how to load them, go here:

Made with Photoshop CS2 so they should work with CS and 7 etc.
